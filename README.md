# Min Activity Tracker

A privacy-first, local-first Android application for tracking phone and app usage patterns with comprehensive data collection and analysis-ready exports.

## üéØ Purpose

Min Activity Tracker helps you understand your digital habits by collecting detailed usage data directly on your device. All data stays local by default, with optional export capabilities for personal analysis or LLM-powered insights.

## ‚ú® Features

- **App Usage Tracking**: Detailed session recording with foreground/background detection
- **Battery Monitoring**: Correlate app usage with battery consumption
- **Location Context**: Optional location tracking for usage pattern analysis
- **Activity Recognition**: Optional motion context from Activity Recognition API
- **Data Export**: JSON and CSV exports (SQLite export planned)
- **Privacy First**: All data stored locally, no cloud dependencies
- **Background Resilience**: Robust tracking that handles Android's background limitations
- **Dark Mode**: Full Material 3 design with dark theme support
- **Automated Exports**: Optional daily JSON/CSV exports with anonymization controls

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

Built with modern Android development practices:
- **Clean Architecture** with MVVM pattern
- **Jetpack Compose** for declarative UI
- **Room Database** for local storage
- **Hilt** for dependency injection
- **WorkManager** for background tasks
- **Material 3** design system

## üì± Requirements

- **Android 10+** (API level 29)
- **Usage Access** permission (required)
- **Location** permission (optional)
- **Battery optimization** whitelist (recommended)

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

1. Download the latest APK from [Releases](https://github.com/cmwen/min-activity-tracker/releases)
2. Install the APK on your Android device
3. Grant necessary permissions during onboarding

### Permissions Setup

1. **Usage Access**: Required for app session tracking
   - Open Settings ‚Üí Apps ‚Üí Special access ‚Üí Usage access
   - Enable for Min Activity Tracker

2. **Location** (Optional): For location-based usage insights
   - Grant when prompted or in app settings

3. **Battery Optimization**: Recommended for consistent tracking
   - Settings ‚Üí Battery ‚Üí Battery optimization
   - Set to "Not optimized" for Min Activity Tracker

## üìä Data Collection

### What We Track
- **App Sessions**: Package name, start/end times, duration
- **Battery Samples**: Battery level changes and charging state
- **Device Events**: Screen on/off, charging events
- **Location** (Optional): GPS coordinates for context
- **Activity Recognition** (Optional): Driving, walking, or still context for sessions

### Data Storage
- All data stored locally in SQLite database
- No cloud sync by default
- Export options available for manual backup

## üì§ Export Formats

### JSON Export
```json
{
  "sessions": [
    {
      "id": "uuid",
      "packageName": "com.example.app",
      "appLabel": "Example App",
      "startTime": "2025-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "endTime": "2025-01-15T10:45:00Z",
      "duration": 900000,
      "batteryStart": 85,
      "batteryEnd": 83
    }
  ],
  "metadata": {
    "exportTime": "2025-01-15T15:00:00Z",
    "version": "1.0.0"
  }
}
```

### CSV Export
Pre-configured for analysis tools like Excel, R, or Python pandas.

### Automated Daily Exports
Opt in from the Settings screen to generate a daily JSON or CSV export (with optional anonymization). Files are written to the app's `exports/` directory and can be shared manually.

## üîß Development
