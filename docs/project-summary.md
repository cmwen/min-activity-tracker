# Updated Tech Stack & Documentation Summary

I've created comprehensive documentation and CI/CD setup for the Min Activity Tracker project based on your requirements. Here's what has been implemented:

## üìã Documents Created

### Core Documentation
- **Software Architecture Design** (`docs/software-architecture-design.md`)
- **Implementation Roadmap** (`docs/implementation-roadmap.md`) - 5 stages with clear outcomes
- **README.md** - Project overview and quick start
- **CONTRIBUTING.md** - Contribution guidelines and development setup
- **LLM.txt** - Structured project information for AI consumption

### Open Source Setup
- **MIT License** (`LICENSE`)
- **GitHub Actions CI/CD** (`.github/workflows/`)
- **Issue Templates** (`.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/`)
- **Pull Request Template** (`.github/pull_request_template.md`)

## üõ†Ô∏è Updated Tech Stack

### Core Requirements Addressed
- **Android 10+ Support** (API 29)
- **5% Max Battery Drain** performance target
- **Dark Mode** with Material 3
- **Error Transparency** with UI reporting and recovery
- **Open Source Ready** with comprehensive documentation

### Testing Framework Recommendation

**Primary: Compose UI Testing**
- ‚úÖ Native Compose support
- ‚úÖ Fast execution
- ‚úÖ Built-in synchronization
- ‚úÖ Semantic tree access
- ‚ùå Limited to Compose UI only

**Secondary: Espresso**
- ‚úÖ Mature and stable
- ‚úÖ Excellent documentation
- ‚úÖ Complex scenario support
- ‚ùå Verbose syntax
- ‚ùå Limited Compose support

**Tertiary: UI Automator**
- ‚úÖ System UI interaction
- ‚úÖ Permission dialog handling
- ‚ùå Slower execution
- ‚ùå More brittle

## üèóÔ∏è Implementation Stages

### Stage 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-2)
- Project setup with Hilt DI
- Room database with entities
- Basic Compose UI with navigation
- Error handling framework

### Stage 2: Data Collection (Weeks 3-4)
- Permission management
- Usage stats tracking
- Background services
- Battery monitoring

### Stage 3: Advanced Features (Weeks 5-6)
- Location tracking (optional)
- Export system (JSON/CSV/SQLite)
- Analysis reports
- Advanced UI features

### Stage 4: Polish (Weeks 7-8)
- Comprehensive testing
- Performance optimization
- Production readiness
- Documentation completion

### Stage 5: Open Source (Week 9)
- CI/CD pipeline
- Community setup
- Final documentation
- Release preparation

## üîß Key Architecture Decisions

### Simplified Requirements
- **No Encryption**: Removed as not required
- **No A11y**: Deferred to later stages
- **No Widget**: Removed from scope
- **No Loading States**: Background app doesn't need them

### Error Handling Philosophy
- Direct UI error reporting
- Automatic recovery where possible
- Clear user guidance for manual fixes
- Graceful degradation

### Open Source Features
- MIT License for maximum compatibility
- Comprehensive CI/CD with GitHub Actions
- Security scanning and code quality checks
- Community-friendly issue and PR templates

## üìä CI/CD Pipeline

### Automated Workflows
- **CI**: Unit tests, lint checks, security scanning
- **Release**: Automated APK building and GitHub releases
- **Code Quality**: detekt, ktlint integration

### Security Features
- Trivy vulnerability scanning
- Automated dependency updates
- Code quality enforcement

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Review Documentation** - All docs are in the `docs/` folder
2. **Start Stage 1** - Begin with foundation implementation
3. **Set up CI/CD** - Configure GitHub secrets for signing
4. **Begin Development** - Follow the implementation roadmap

The project is now fully prepared for open source development with clear stages, comprehensive documentation, and automated CI/CD pipeline. Each stage has specific deliverables and success criteria to ensure steady progress toward a production-ready application.
