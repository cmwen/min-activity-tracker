# Implementation Log

Date: 2025-08-17

Summary
- Implemented Stage 1 foundation artifacts to get a working, buildable skeleton.
- Focus was on Room database entities, a simple repository, a testable ViewModel, and a Compose UI list screen.
- Hilt was attempted but deferred due to kapt / javapoet incompatibilities with the current Kotlin/AGP versions in this repository; the project was left buildable without Hilt.

Files added
- app/src/main/java/io/cmwen/min_activity_tracker/data/database/
  - AppSessionEntity.kt
  - DeviceEventEntity.kt
  - BatterySampleEntity.kt
  - AnalysisReportEntity.kt
  - SessionDao.kt
  - MinActivityDatabase.kt

- app/src/main/java/io/cmwen/min_activity_tracker/data/repository/
  - SessionRepository.kt
  - SessionRepositoryImpl.kt

- app/src/main/java/io/cmwen/min_activity_tracker/presentation/viewmodels/
  - SessionsViewModel.kt (and simple factory)

- app/src/main/java/io/cmwen/min_activity_tracker/presentation/ui/
  - SessionsScreen.kt (SessionList and SessionRow composables)

- app/src/main/java/io/cmwen/min_activity_tracker/
  - MinActivityApplication.kt (placeholder Application)
  - MainActivity.kt (wired to show SessionsScreen with a placeholder repo/viewmodel)

Build & verification
- Commands run:

```bash
./gradlew assembleDebug --warning-mode=all
```

- Result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL (after iterating on Hilt-related issues and temporarily disabling Hilt).

Decisions & rationale
- Hilt was initially added but produced kapt / javapoet errors when compiling with Kotlin 2.0.21 and AGP 8.11.1 in this workspace. To keep progress moving, Hilt usage was deferred and a manual/placeholder DI approach was used instead. This keeps the codebase buildable and testable; Hilt can be reintroduced later once compatible versions are chosen or after switching to another DI library.

Next steps (recommended)
1. Reintroduce DI
   - Option A: Fix Hilt version and plugin compatibility (pin matching versions or use Kotlin 1.9.x if Hilt requires). Re-add `@HiltAndroidApp`, `@HiltViewModel`, and `AppModule` bindings.
   - Option B: Use manual DI or Koin to avoid annotation processing issues during early development.

2. Database
   - Implement DAOs for device events and battery samples.
   - Wire a real Room database instance in the app (replace placeholder DAO in `MainActivity`).
   - Add migration scaffolding and unit/integration tests using an in-memory Room database.

3. UI & Navigation
   - Add Compose Navigation and wire screens (Dashboard, Timeline, Settings).
   - Add more comprehensive previews and UI tests (Compose testing).

4. Testing & Quality
   - Add unit tests for `SessionsViewModel` and `SessionRepository` (use `kotlinx-coroutines-test`).
   - Configure detekt and ktlint in the project.

If you'd like, I can implement any of the next steps now â€” tell me which one to proceed with.
