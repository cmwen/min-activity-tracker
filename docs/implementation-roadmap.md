# Implementation Roadmap - Min Activity Tracker
## Multi-Stage Development Plan

### Stage 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)
**Outcome**: Working skeleton app with database, basic UI, and dependency injection

#### Tasks:
1. **Project Setup & Dependencies**
   - [x] Update `gradle/libs.versions.toml` with all required dependencies
   - [x] Configure Hilt dependency injection (completed with KSP)
   - [x] Set up Room database configuration
   - [x] Configure build scripts for testing frameworks
   - [x] Add detekt configuration (in-progress triage)
   - [x] Add ktlint for code quality (Gradle plugin configured with CLI 1.7.1)

2. **Database Layer**
   - [x] Define Room entities (AppSession, DeviceEvent, BatterySample, AnalysisReport)
   - [x] Create DAOs for each entity
   - [x] Implement database migrations framework (scaffold added: DatabaseMigrations, registered in DatabaseProvider)
   - [x] Implemented concrete v1→v2 migration (adds nullable `notes` column to `app_sessions`)
   - [x] Added a JVM-safe unit test asserting migration registration/SQL constant
   - [x] Create Repository interfaces and implementations (DAOs and basic repositories implemented)
   - [x] Add database integration tests

3. **Basic UI Framework**
   - [x] Set up Compose Navigation
   - [x] Create basic screen composables (Sessions list composable created)
   - [x] Implement Material 3 theming with dark mode support
   - [x] Create error handling UI components
   - [x] Add basic ViewModels (constructor-injectable, Hilt deferred)

4. **Error Handling Framework**
   - [x] Define error types and handling interfaces
   - [x] Implement global error handler (singleton `ErrorHandler` with in-memory history; MAX_ERROR_HISTORY constant added)
   - [x] Create error display UI components
   - [x] Add error recovery mechanisms

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Buildable app with navigation between screens
- [x] Room database with basic entities
- [x] Hilt dependency injection fully configured with KSP (replaced manual DI container)
- [x] Database migration scaffold and a concrete v1→v2 migration implemented; comprehensive integration tests added including migration testing
- [x] Error handling framework in place
- [x] Basic UI with dark mode support

Detekt & formatting status (developer notes):
- Detekt is configured; triage is in progress — many noisy rules were temporarily relaxed to allow incremental fixes. Current detekt overall debt has been reduced through targeted fixes (naming, magic numbers, new-line EOFs, spread operator). A final pass will re-enable config validation and tighten rules.
- Ktlint plugin is active in the build; enforcement now runs via `./gradlew ktlintCheck` with CLI 1.7.1 and HTML reporting.

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Android Background Limitations**: Implement robust service restart mechanisms and user guidance
- **Permission Model Changes**: Design flexible permission handling that adapts to Android updates
- **Database Migration**: Comprehensive migration testing and fallback strategies
- **Battery Optimization**: Continuous monitoring and optimization throughout development

### Timeline Risks:
- **Stage Dependencies**: Each stage builds on the previous, delays compound
- **Testing Complexity**: Allocate sufficient time for comprehensive testing
- **Documentation Overhead**: Write documentation incrementally during development

### Quality Risks:
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios testing across all stages
- **Performance**: Regular performance testing and optimization
- **User Experience**: User testing and feedback incorporation at each stage
