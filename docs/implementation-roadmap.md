## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks:
- **Android Background Limitations**: Implement robust service restart mechanisms and user guidance
- **Permission Model Changes**: Design flexible permission handling that adapts to Android updates
- **Database Migration**: Comprehensive migration testing and fallback strategies
- **Battery Optimization**: Continuous monitoring and optimization throughout development

### Timeline Risks:
- **Stage Dependencies**: Each stage builds on the previous, delays compound
- **Testing Complexity**: Allocate sufficient time for comprehensive testing
- **Documentation Overhead**: Write documentation incrementally during development

### Quality Risks:
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error scenarios testing across all stages
