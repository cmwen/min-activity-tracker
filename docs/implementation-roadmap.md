# Implementation Roadmap - Min Activity Tracker
## Multi-Stage Development Plan

### Stage 1: Foundation & Core Infrastructure (Weeks 1-2)

#### Tasks:
1. **Project Setup & Dependencies**
   - [x] Update `gradle/libs.versions.toml` with all required dependencies
   - [x] Configure Hilt dependency injection (completed with KSP)
   - [x] Set up Room database configuration
   - [x] Configure build scripts for testing frameworks
   - [x] Add detekt configuration (in-progress triage)
   - [ ] Add ktlint for code quality (blocked by classpath version conflicts; needs resolution in future iteration)

2. **Database Layer**
   - [x] Define Room entities (AppSession, DeviceEvent, BatterySample, AnalysisReport)
   - [x] Create DAOs for each entity
   - [x] Implement database migrations framework (scaffold added: DatabaseMigrations, registered in DatabaseProvider)
   - [x] Implemented concrete v1→v2 migration (adds nullable `notes` column to `app_sessions`)
   - [x] Added a JVM-safe unit test asserting migration registration/SQL constant
   - [x] Create Repository interfaces and implementations (DAOs and basic repositories implemented)
   - [x] Add database integration tests

3. **Basic UI Framework**
   - [x] Set up Compose Navigation
   - [x] Create basic screen composables (Sessions list composable created)
   - [x] Implement Material 3 theming with dark mode support
   - [x] Create error handling UI components
   - [x] Add basic ViewModels (constructor-injectable, Hilt deferred)

4. **Error Handling Framework**
   - [x] Define error types and handling interfaces
   - [x] Implement global error handler (singleton `ErrorHandler` with in-memory history; MAX_ERROR_HISTORY constant added)
   - [x] Create error display UI components
   - [x] Add error recovery mechanisms

**Deliverables**:
- [x] Buildable app with navigation between screens
- [x] Room database with basic entities
- [x] Hilt dependency injection fully configured with KSP (replaced manual DI container)
- [x] Database migration scaffold and a concrete v1→v2 migration implemented; comprehensive integration tests added including migration testing
- [x] Error handling framework in place
- [x] Basic UI with dark mode support

Detekt & formatting status (developer notes):
- Detekt is configured; triage is in progress — many noisy rules were temporarily relaxed to allow incremental fixes. Current detekt overall debt has been reduced through targeted fixes (naming, magic numbers, new-line EOFs, spread operator). A final pass will re-enable config validation and tighten rules.
- Ktlint integration attempted but temporarily removed due to version conflicts with current Gradle setup; proper version coordinates need to be determined and applied in future iteration.
