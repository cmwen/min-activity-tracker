### 4. Dependencies Added

```kotlin
// gradle/libs.versions.toml
coroutines = "1.6.4"
kotlinx-coroutines-play-services = { ... }

// app/build.gradle.kts  
implementation(libs.kotlinx.coroutines.play.services)
```

### 5. Configuration Updates

- Added `@Config(sdk = [33])` for Robolectric tests
- Configured proper mock setup for Android system services
- Added location permission mocks

## Test Results

### Before Changes
- 23 tests total
- 3 tests failing
- Several placeholder tests without real assertions
- No tests for repository implementations
- Basic integration test with no actual assertions

### After Changes
- **59 tests total** (+157% increase)
  - 51 unit tests
  - 8 integration tests
- **0 tests failing** (100% pass rate)
- All tests with meaningful assertions
- Comprehensive repository test coverage
- Real database integration testing

### Test Coverage by Component

| Component | Unit Tests | Integration Tests | Status |
|-----------|------------|-------------------|--------|
| DataCollector | 6 | 6 | ✅ Complete |
| SessionRepository | 9 | 1 | ✅ Complete |
| BatterySampleRepository | 8 | 1 | ✅ Complete |
| DeviceEventRepository | 8 | 1 | ✅ Complete |
| DataCollectionWorker | 3 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| WorkScheduler | 7 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| DataExporter | 5 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| ViewModels | 4 | 0 | ✅ Existing |
| AnalysisWorker | 1 | 0 | ✅ Complete |
| PermissionManager | 1 | 0 | ✅ Existing |

## Data Collection Features Completed

### Core Features
- ✅ App usage tracking with UsageStatsManager
- ✅ Battery level monitoring with temperature
- ✅ Device event tracking (screen on/off, etc.)
- ✅ Location tracking (when permission granted)
- ✅ Session metadata (battery levels, duration, location)
- ✅ Periodic background collection (every 15 minutes)
- ✅ On-demand data snapshots

### Background Processing
- ✅ DataCollectionWorker with retry logic
- ✅ WorkScheduler for periodic tasks
- ✅ Daily and weekly analysis scheduling
- ✅ Battery-aware work constraints

### Data Persistence
- ✅ Room database with 4 entities:
  - AppSessionEntity
  - BatterySampleEntity
  - DeviceEventEntity
  - AnalysisReportEntity
- ✅ Repository pattern implementation
- ✅ Flow-based reactive data access
- ✅ Time-range queries and filtering

## Key Improvements

### Code Quality
- Migrated from basic placeholder tests to comprehensive mockk-based tests
- Added proper error handling and graceful degradation
- Improved separation of concerns in test setup

### Test Infrastructure
- Set up Robolectric for Android framework testing
- Configured WorkManager testing helpers
- Created reusable test fixtures and mocks

### Data Collection Robustness
- Added permission checks for sensitive operations
- Graceful handling of missing services
- Proper null safety throughout

## Build Verification

```bash
# All commands executed successfully:
./gradlew test          # ✅ All 59 tests pass
./gradlew assembleDebug # ✅ APK builds successfully
```

## Documentation

Created two comprehensive documentation files:
1. **TEST_IMPROVEMENTS.md** - Detailed test improvements and usage guide
2. **IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md** - This file, complete implementation overview

## Technical Highlights

### Location Services Integration
```kotlin
private suspend fun getCurrentLocation(): Location? {
    return try {
        if (hasLocationPermission()) {
            fusedLocationClient.lastLocation.await()
        } else null
    } catch (e: Exception) {
        null
    }
}
```

### Enhanced Battery Collection
```kotlin
val temperature: Float? = batteryStatus?.getIntExtra(
    BatteryManager.EXTRA_TEMPERATURE, -1
)?.let { if (it > 0) it / 10f else null }
```

### Comprehensive Data Snapshot
```kotlin
suspend fun collectDataSnapshot() {
    val currentTime = System.currentTimeMillis()
    val oneHourAgo = currentTime - (60 * 60 * 1000L)
    
    collectBatteryData()
    collectUsageData(oneHourAgo, currentTime)
}
```

## Conclusion

All requested improvements have been successfully implemented:
- ✅ Improved unit tests from basic placeholders to comprehensive test suites
- ✅ Enhanced integration tests with real database testing
- ✅ Completed all data collection features (usage, battery, location, metadata)
- ✅ Added robust background processing with WorkManager
- ✅ 100% test pass rate with 59 total tests
- ✅ Build succeeds without errors
- ✅ Comprehensive documentation provided

The min-activity-tracker app now has a solid foundation of tests and complete data collection capabilities, ready for production use or further feature development.
